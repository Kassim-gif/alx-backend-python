02. Python - Async Comprehension
Write a coroutine called async_generator that takes no arguments.

The coroutine will loop 10 times, each time asynchronously wait 1 second, then yield a random number between 0 and 10. Use the random module.

All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
All your functions should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'
A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
All your functions and coroutines must be type-annotated.

Import async_generator from the previous task and then write a coroutine called async_comprehension that takes no arguments.

The coroutine will collect 10 random numbers using an async comprehensing over async_generator, then return the 10 random numbers.
